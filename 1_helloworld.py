# Let's start with a programmer's classic: Hello World!

print("Hello world!")

# This is the only line of active code in the file. All the other 
# lines here are comments; these are for humans and the computer
# will not read them. To make a comment, put a # in front of the line.

# Just like Word reads `.docx` files, Python reads `.py` files; 
# except instead of containing your essay, `.py` files contain 
# instructions that tell Python what you want it to do.

# Remember, to run, open a terminal window and type 'python 1_helloworld.py'. 
# You need to install python to do this!

# You can also print other things, like numbers:

print("Now for some calculator stuff!")
print(5)
print(2+7)
print(33*4)

# But python can help you do much more than just calculator work. To do this, it needs to be able to remember things...
